SampleTraits3-12-final.csv	The phenotype measurements used in the analysis. All floral measurements are averaged across all flowers measured for an individual. Columns: Population (the species of the sample - 1=I. cordatotriloba, 2=I. lacunosa), Dam (accession / female parent), Internode1 (length of stem from cotyledons to first true leaf, measured on day 21 from planting), Internode2 (length of stem from first true leaf to second true leaf, measured on day 21 from planting), Internode3 (length of stem from second true leaf to third true leaf, measured on day 21 from planting), flowers.day (number of flowers open on the day of measurement), Pedunclelengthnodetoflower (length of the cyme starting from the vine attachment site), Cor.Length (height of the corolla, from the base of the flower to the lip), Cor.Width (width of the corolla, measured across the center), Anthersbelow (number of anthers below the stigma), Nectar_volume (volume of nectar in milliliters), Sugar_conc_average (concentration of sugar in nectar, in mg/mL), Leafdissection (leaf dissection score)
Data_and_data_cleaning/SortedData3-12.xlsx	The phenotype data in SampleTraits3-12-final.csv with sorting information about correspondences between sites, accessions, and individuals. Same columns, and Site_numeric (the numeric conversion for the site), Individual (the individual plant), Site_accession (a unique code combining sites and accessions), Accession-Dam (a unique number for each accession), Species (the species), Site (the site of the collection), Accession (the original accession number, not matched to site), Ind_from_Acc (which selfed seed from the accession the measured individual is).
