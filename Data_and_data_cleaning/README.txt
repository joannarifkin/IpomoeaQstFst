SortedData3-12.xlsx	The phenotype data used to run the analyses (in /QstFstComp/SampleTraits3-12-final.csv) with sorting information about correspondences between sites, accessions, and individuals. Same columns, and Site_numeric (the numeric conversion for the site), Individual (the individual plant), Site_accession (a unique code combining sites and accessions), Accession-Dam (a unique number for each accession), Species (the species), Site (the site of the collection), Accession (the original accession number, not matched to site), Ind_from_Acc (which selfed seed from the accession the measured individual is).
Floral_traits_final_with_Irene.xlsx Final combined individual floral trait measurements. All individual measurements. Sheets: FloralMeasurements (all individual floral measurements); Counts (tracking number of flowers sampled from each individual across all sheets); PollenCollections (collections of total pollen from individual with date); Measurement_Defs (definitions of all floral measurements)
FstQst Nectar Measurements.xlsx Irene's spreadsheet of individual nectar measurements. Each row is an individual flower. Columns: Date (measurement date)	# (sample of day)	Time (Measurement time)	Individual (Individual ID number)	Infl. # pos (position on inflorescence)	Sepal Length (length of a sepal)	Cor. Length (tissue length of the corolla)	Style Length (length of the style from the ovary to the stigma)	Nectar (UNC) (length of nectar in capillary tube)	Sugar (UND) (concentration of undiluted nectar)	Sugar (D+2.5) (concentration of nectar diluted with 2.5uL water)
Internodes_170206.xlsx Final spreadsheet of all internode measurements. Rows indicate individuals. Columns: Year (year of planting)	Family (individual identity number)	Species (Ipomoea cordatotriloba, I. lacunosa, I. leucantha, or I. austinii)	Female (the accession the seeds were derived from)	Individual (individual's identity number)	Replanted (whether the original seed failed to germinate and, if so, when it was replaced)	Internode1 (length of stem from cotyledons to first true leaf, measured on day 21 from planting) 	Internode2 (length of stem from first true leaf to second true leaf, measured on day 21 from planting) 	Internode3 (length of stem from second true leaf to third true leaf, measured on day 21 from planting). Also includes notes on trichomes (hairy!) and average values for all four species.
CleanIndividualMeans6-26-2018.xlsx All cleaned averaged individual measurements used in final analyses, with two mislabeled individuals removed. Same data as SampleTraits3-12-final
